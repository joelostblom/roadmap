# The Vega and Vega-Lite Roadmap

In this repository, you can find the [Vega and Vega-Lite Roadmap](https://github.com/vega/roadmap/projects/1).

We want Vega and Vega-Lite to become the standard languages for data visualization practice and research, regardless of the underlying programming language used (e.g., JavaScript, Python, etc.). A core principle of Vega-Lite is compiling a declarative specification of visual encodings and interactions to low-level Vega for maximum flexibility. To this end, it is important to refine and extend the feature set and improve scalability to larger datasets. All of the planned improvements will benefit the whole Vega ecosystem including tools such as [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) in Python. 

**If you or your company is interested in helping with the roadmap, please get in touch!**
